POM File
Each project has a corresponding POM file that is located in the root directory.
Whenever a goal (a specific build task) has to be executed, Maven looks for the configuration details in POM.
Project details can be represented in the form of XML file called pom.xml.
It is the fundamental unit that contains information about the project.
It holds all the resources required for a build such as source code location, test source, dependency details such as external or internal dependency etc.
